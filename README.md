a little python bot I worked on.
This is not the full version btw. This will not include the mute or warn commands. Those are only on the full version!

Might make the source of the full version public sometime in the future idk.

Link for the full bot: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=806679245987512322&permissions=0&scope=bot

TODO:
\n-Add a error handler
\n-Add a few more misc commands

To run the bot you need to download Python (preferably version 3) and the discord.py library. Then you just run the bot.py file.

If you need any help or have any questions feel free to email me at me@sofshant.club or at my discord Sofshant#0001
