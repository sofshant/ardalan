a little python bot I worked on.
This is not the full version btw. This will not include the mute or warn commands. Those are only on the full version!

Might make the source of the full version public sometime in the future idk.

Link for the full bot: https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=806679245987512322&permissions=0&scope=bot

TODO: <br>
 -Nothing! All done ðŸ˜Ž


To run the bot you need to download Python version 3 and download the discrd.py library. You can do that by typing ```pip install discord.py``` in cmd or whatever console you're using. Once done that, run the bot.py file. You can do that by opening whatever ide you have and clicking run or by entering the directory and typing ```python bot.py```

If you need any help or have any questions feel free to email me at me@sofshant.club or at my discord Sofshant#0001
